Outline of Steps to Complete the Project

# 1. Research and Planning
Understand Requirements:

Carefully review the MVP requirements and tech choices.
Decide if the platform will be a web app or a progressive web app (PWA).
Research APIs:

Identify and research at least two free museum or university APIs (e.g., The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API, Harvard Art Museums API).
Sign up for developer accounts and obtain API keys if required.
Define Features and User Stories:

Break down MVP requirements into user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can search artworks across collections to explore items of interest").
Prioritize features based on their importance and complexity.
Create Wireframes and UI Design:

Sketch or use tools like Figma to design a responsive UI.
Ensure designs accommodate accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
Set Up the Tech Stack:

Choose between JavaScript or TypeScript.
Decide whether to use React or React Native based on your familiarity and project needs.
Plan how the application will be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages for web or Expo for mobile).


# 2. Environment Setup
Initialize the Project:

Set up a new project using create-react-app or create-react-native-app.
Install essential dependencies (e.g., React, Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation).
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file for API keys and sensitive information.
Use libraries like dotenv to handle these securely.
Version Control:

Set up a GitHub repository to track progress and share the project.
Follow best practices for commits and branching.


# 3. Backend Integration
Connect to Museum APIs:

Write reusable API utility functions to fetch data.
Handle API errors gracefully and display loading states in the UI.
Data Handling:

Normalize and transform API responses into a consistent structure.
Use pagination parameters from APIs to fetch results incrementally.


# 4. Frontend Development
Build Core Features:

Search Functionality: Create a search bar for querying artworks.
Browse Artworks: Implement a paginated list view for artworks.
Filters and Sorting: Allow users to refine results (e.g., by date, artist).
Display Artwork Details:

Create a detail view for each artwork, showing images and key information.
Manage Saved Exhibitions:

Enable users to add/remove artworks from a saved list.
Store saved exhibitions locally (e.g., in localStorage or IndexedDB for web, AsyncStorage for mobile).
Navigation:

Implement navigation (e.g., React Router for web, React Navigation for mobile).
Error Handling and Accessibility:

Add user-friendly error messages and loading indicators.
Test for accessibility with tools like Lighthouse or axe.


# 5. Testing
Unit Testing:
Test utility functions (e.g., API fetchers, data transformations).
Integration Testing:
Test user flows (e.g., searching, adding/removing items, navigating).
UI Testing:
Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library to test UI components.


# 6. Deployment
Build and Host the Project:
For web: Use GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
For mobile: Use Expo to host and distribute the app.
Test Deployment:
Verify all features work on the hosted platform.


# 7. Documentation
Write a README:
Include an overview, instructions for running locally, and a link to the hosted app.
Create a Walkthrough Video:
Record a video showcasing the features and upload it to YouTube.
